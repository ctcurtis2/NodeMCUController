# NodeMCUController
This is to create a controller for my workshop heaters. The controller will be built with a NodeMCU LUA programmed as an arduino.

The initial controller will have the following functions:
1. Publish interior/exterior temperatures to PubNub for display on the internet
2. An ability to turn the heater on remotely for a fixed period of time (such as 4 hours).
